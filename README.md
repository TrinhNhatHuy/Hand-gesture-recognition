# Hand-gesture-recognition
A real-time hand gesture recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras. This project detects hand gestures from a webcam feed and classifies them into predefined categories, enabling touchless human-computer interaction.

Key Features
📷 Real-time processing via webcam using OpenCV

✋ Hand detection with cvzone.HandTrackingModule

🧠 CNN-based classification (Keras/TensorFlow model)

🖐️ Robust cropping/resizing with boundary checks

📊 Label mapping from labels.txt for dynamic gesture naming
